## Short Description
Empowering individuals through the transformative power of AI fluency, fostering effective human-AI collaboration. An innovative program that combines theoretical frameworks with practical skills to enhance your ability to work with AI systems.

## About the Project
Botspeak is a comprehensive AI fluency framework that transforms you from an AI tourist into a fluent native. Through our YouTube series, books, and articles, we cultivate your ability to think alongside AI, distributing cognitive tasks strategically, communicating intentions clearly, evaluating outputs critically, and using these powerful tools responsibly. Led by Dr. Nik Bear Brown, Associate Teaching Professor at Northeastern University, our show-and-tell approach demonstrates these skills through practical AI project development, giving you both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience.

## Key Features
