# Finance Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1: Financial Assets
**Question**: Which of the following are financial assets?
- Share of stock
- Machine
- Patent
- Bank loan
- $100 note

**Answer**:
- Share of stock ✓
- Bank loan ✓
- $100 note ✓

**Solution**:
Financial assets are claims on future cash flows, essentially representing financial claims or ownership rights rather than physical objects.

- Share of stock is a financial asset as it represents partial ownership in a company and a claim on its future earnings and assets.
- Machine is a physical or tangible asset (also called a real asset), not a financial asset.
- Patent is an intangible asset that gives exclusive rights to an invention, but it's not considered a financial asset.
- Bank loan (from the lender's perspective) is a financial asset because it represents a claim on future payments from the borrower.
- $100 note is a financial asset as it represents a claim on the central bank or government that issued it.

## Problem 2: Risk-Return Relationship
**Question**: In general, an asset with higher expected return:
- is more expensive
- has higher risk
- has lower risk
- is less expensive

**Answer**: has higher risk

**Solution**:
This is a fundamental principle in finance known as the risk-return tradeoff. Investors typically require higher potential returns to compensate for taking on additional risk. Assets with higher expected returns are generally riskier because those returns are less certain or more volatile.

This relationship forms the basis of modern portfolio theory and explains why, for example, stocks (which are riskier) have historically provided higher average returns than bonds or cash equivalents (which are less risky).

## Problem 3: Historical Returns of Asset Classes
**Question Part 1**: Historically, which asset class had the highest return in the U.S.A.?
- Short-term government bills
- Large-company stocks
- Long-term government bonds
- Small-company stocks

**Answer**: Small-company stocks

**Solution**: Small-company stocks (also called small-cap stocks) have historically outperformed the other asset classes listed over long time periods, though with significantly higher volatility and risk. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the "small-cap premium" in finance literature.

**Question Part 2**: Historically, which asset class had the highest variability of returns in the U.S.A.?
- Short-term government bills
- Large-company stocks
- Small-company stocks
- Long-term government bonds

**Answer**: Small-company stocks

**Solution**: Small-company stocks typically exhibit the greatest volatility or standard deviation of returns among the asset classes listed. This higher variability reflects the greater risks associated with smaller companies, which tend to be more vulnerable to economic downturns, have less diversified business models, and face greater challenges in accessing capital markets compared to larger companies.

## Problem 4: Small-Company Stock Premium
**Question**: What might be reasons that small-company stocks earn higher returns than large-company stocks on average?
- Small-company stocks are more exposed to inflation
- Small-company stocks are less liquid
- Small-company stocks are less safe
- Small-company stocks have a longer investment horizon

**Answer**:
- Small-company stocks are less liquid ✓
- Small-company stocks are less safe ✓

**Solution**:
The higher returns observed in small-company stocks relative to large-company stocks can be attributed to risk premiums that investors demand as compensation for bearing certain risks:

- Small-company stocks are less liquid: Small-company stocks typically have lower trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads compared to large-company stocks, making them harder to buy and sell at fair market value without affecting the price. Investors demand higher returns to compensate for this liquidity risk.

- Small-company stocks are less safe: Small-company stocks exhibit greater price volatility and are generally considered riskier investments. Their prices fluctuate more dramatically, and they face higher business risks compared to large-company stocks.

- Small-company stocks are more exposed to inflation: While this may seem logical, it was marked as incorrect. Some small companies may actually be more nimble in adjusting prices in inflationary environments, but this is not considered a primary driver of the small-cap premium.

- Small-company stocks have a longer investment horizon: This was marked as incorrect. Investment horizon is more a characteristic of the investor than an inherent property of the asset class itself. The time horizon needed depends on risk tolerance rather than being an intrinsic feature of small-company stocks.

The evidence most strongly supports liquidity risk and safety risk (volatility) as the primary drivers of the small-cap premium.

## Problem 5: Measuring Risk
**Question**: We measure the risk of a single asset or portfolio by measuring the:
- standard deviation of returns
- asset's alpha
- asset's beta
- skew of its return distribution

**Answer**: standard deviation of returns

**Solution**:
Standard deviation of returns is the most common and traditional measure of total risk for a single asset or portfolio. It quantifies the dispersion or volatility of returns around the mean return, indicating how much the actual returns tend to deviate from the expected return.

The other options have different meanings in finance:
- Asset's alpha: Measures excess return relative to a benchmark (risk-adjusted performance), not risk itself
- Asset's beta: Measures systematic risk (market risk) or how sensitive an asset is to market movements, but only captures one component of risk
- Skew of return distribution: Measures the asymmetry of the return distribution, which is a characteristic of returns but not the primary measure of risk

## Problem 6: Geometric Average Return
**Question**: Which statements are correct about the geometric average return?
- is usually less than the arithmetic mean
- takes into account compounding
- is the simple average of the individual returns
- is better for forecasting returns over many periods

**Answer**:
- is usually less than the arithmetic mean ✓
- takes into account compounding ✓
- is better for forecasting returns over many periods ✓

**Solution**:
- The geometric average return is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean (with equality only when all returns are identical). This is due to Jensen's inequality.
- The geometric average properly accounts for the compounding effect of returns over time, which is why it's sometimes called the "time-weighted" return.
- It is NOT the simple average (arithmetic mean) of individual returns.
- The geometric average is more appropriate for forecasting multi-period returns because it accounts for compounding, making it a more accurate representation of the actual investment experience over time.

## Problem 7: Compounding Interest
**Question Part 1**: If interest is compounded quarterly, the ________ expresses the interest rate as if it were compounded annually.
- effective annual rate
- quoted rate
- annual percentage rate
- period rate

**Answer**: effective annual rate

**Solution**: When interest is compounded quarterly (or at any frequency other than annually), the effective annual rate (EAR) provides a standardized way to express what the annual return actually is after accounting for the compounding effect. The EAR takes the quoted rate and adjusts it to show the true annual yield when compounding occurs multiple times within the year.

**Question Part 2**: Given a fixed annual percentage rate, compounding more frequently leads to:
- a lower effective annual rate
- a higher annual percentage rate
- a lower annual percentage rate
- a higher effective annual rate

**Answer**: a higher effective annual rate

**Solution**: When the annual percentage rate (APR) remains constant, increasing the frequency of compounding will result in a higher effective annual rate (EAR). This occurs because more frequent compounding allows interest to be earned on previously accrued interest more often throughout the year.

## Problem 8: Risk Premium
**Question**: The risk premium is:
- normally positive for risky assets
- the difference between the expected rate of return on an asset and the risk-free rate
- the reward for bearing risk
- normally zero for risky assets

**Answer**:
- normally positive for risky assets ✓
- the difference between the expected rate of return on an asset and the risk-free rate ✓
- the reward for bearing risk ✓

**Solution**:
- The risk premium is normally positive for risky assets because investors require compensation for taking on additional risk.
- By definition, the risk premium is the difference between the expected return on an asset and the risk-free rate.
- The risk premium represents the additional return that investors demand as compensation for bearing risk.
- If the risk premium were zero for risky assets, investors would have no incentive to invest in them over risk-free assets, which is incorrect.

## Problem 9: Calculating Holding Period Returns
**Question**: Calculate the rates of return (holding period returns) for the following stocks:

| Stock | Beginning price: P₀ | Ending price: P₁ | Dividend payment: D₁ |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| A     | 35.38               | 30.06            | 2.6                  |
| B     | 105.74              | 115.92           | 5.25                 |
| C     | 4.25                | 5.58             | 0.18                 |

**Answer**:
- Stock A: -0.0769 or -7.69%
- Stock C: 0.3553 or 35.53%

**Solution**:
The formula for holding period return is:
R = (P₁ - P₀ + D₁) / P₀

For Stock A:
R = ($30.06 - $35.38 + $2.6) / $35.38
R = (-$5.32 + $2.6) / $35.38
R = -$2.72 / $35.38
R = -0.0769 or -7.69%

For Stock C:
R = ($5.58 - $4.25 + $0.18) / $4.25
R = ($1.33 + $0.18) / $4.25
R = $1.51 / $4.25
R = 0.3553 or 35.53%

## Problem 10: Risk Premiums for Different Asset Classes
**Question**: Below are the expected returns for different asset classes for next year:

| Asset class           | Exp. return |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| T-bills               | 2.5%        |
| Corporate bonds       | 4.3%        |
| Small company stocks  | 16.7%       |
| Large company stocks  | 8.5%        |

**Question Part 1**: What is the risk premium for corporate bonds?
**Answer**: 0.0180 or 1.80%

**Question Part 2**: What is the risk premium for small company stocks?
**Answer**: 0.1420 or 14.20%

**Question Part 3**: What is the risk premium for large company stocks?
**Answer**: 0.0600 or 6.00%

**Solution**:
The risk premium is calculated as: Risk Premium = Expected Return on Asset - Risk-Free Rate
In this problem, T-bills (2.5%) represent the risk-free rate.

For corporate bonds:
Risk Premium = 4.3% - 2.5% = 1.8% = 0.0180

For small company stocks:
Risk Premium = 16.7% - 2.5% = 14.2% = 0.1420

For large company stocks:
Risk Premium = 8.5% - 2.5% = 6.0% = 0.0600

## Problem 11: Excess Returns for Different Asset Classes
**Question**: Below are the returns for different asset classes for a particular year:

| Asset class           | Return |
|-----------------------|--------|
| T-bills               | 1.7%   |
| Corporate bonds       | 4.6%   |
| Small company stocks  | 16.5%  |
| Large company stocks  | 10.1%  |

**Question Part 1**: What was the excess return for corporate bonds?
**Answer**: 0.029 or 2.9%

**Question Part 2**: What was the excess return for small company stocks?
**Answer**: 0.148 or 14.8%

**Question Part 3**: What was the excess return for large company stocks?
**Answer**: 0.084 or 8.4%

**Solution**:
The excess return is calculated as: Excess Return = Asset Return - Risk-Free Rate
In this problem, T-bills (1.7%) represent the risk-free rate.

For corporate bonds:
Excess Return = 4.6% - 1.7% = 2.9% = 0.029

For small company stocks:
Excess Return = 16.5% - 1.7% = 14.8% = 0.148

For large company stocks:
Excess Return = 10.1% - 1.7% = 8.4% = 0.084

## Problem 12: Calculating Returns for an Investment
**Question**: You're evaluating the performance of your pension fund. You invested $100 initially, which grew to $101 after 4 months, and then to $110 after another 5 months.

**Question Part 1**: What was your rate of return during the first 4 months?
**Answer**: 0.0100 or 1.00%

**Question Part 2**: What was your return during the next 5 months?
**Answer**: 0.0891 or 8.91%

**Question Part 3**: What was your total return over the 9 months?
**Answer**: 0.1000 or 10.00%

**Question Part 4**: The fund paid you a dividend of $6 after the first 4 months. What was your return for this period?
**Answer**: 0.0700 or 7.00%

**Question Part 5**: Given the information in part 4, what was your total return over the entire period (4+5 months)?
**Answer**: 0.1600 or 16.00%

**Question Part 6**: Given the information in part 5, what was your geometric average monthly return?
**Answer**: 0.0166 or 1.66%

**Solution**:
For Part 1 (Return during first 4 months):
R = (P₁ - P₀) / P₀ = ($101 - $100) / $100 = $1 / $100 = 0.0100 or 1.00%

For Part 2 (Return during next 5 months):
R = (P₁ - P₀) / P₀ = ($110 - $101) / $101 = $9 / $101 = 0.0891 or 8.91%

For Part 3 (Total return over 9 months):
R = (P₁ - P₀) / P₀ = ($110 - $100) / $100 = $10 / $100 = 0.1000 or 10.00%

For Part 4 (Return during first 4 months with dividend):
R = (P₁ - P₀ + D) / P₀ = ($101 - $100 + $6) / $100 = $7 / $100 = 0.0700 or 7.00%

For Part 5 (Total return over 9 months with dividend):
Total wealth at end = $110 + $6 = $116
R = (Final wealth - Initial investment) / Initial investment = ($116 - $100) / $100 = $16 / $100 = 0.1600 or 16.00%

For Part 6 (Geometric average monthly return):
R_g = (1 + R)^(1/n) - 1 = (1 + 0.1600)^(1/9) - 1 = (1.1600)^(0.1111...) - 1 = 1.0166 - 1 = 0.0166 or 1.66%

## Problem 13: Average Annual Returns
**Question**: We know the following historical rates of return for stocks A and B:

| Year | Stock A | Stock B |
|------|---------|---------|
| 2024 | -0.1    | 0.01    |
| 2023 | 0.08    | 0.05    |
| 2022 | 0.17    | 0.07    |

**Question Part 1**: What is the (arithmetic) average annual return for stock A?
**Answer**: 0.050 or 5.0%

**Question Part 2**: What is the (arithmetic) average annual return for stock B?
**Answer**: 0.043 or 4.3%

**Solution**:
The arithmetic average return is calculated by summing all returns and dividing by the number of periods.

For Stock A:
Arithmetic Average = (-0.10 + 0.08 + 0.17) / 3 = 0.15 / 3 = 0.050 or 5.0%

For Stock B:
Arithmetic Average = (0.01 + 0.05 + 0.07) / 3 = 0.13 / 3 = 0.043 or 4.3%

## Problem 14: Geometric Average Return
**Question**: You invested $9,000 in a mutual fund 12 years ago. Your money has since grown to $15,797.

**Question Part 1**: What was the geometric average return over the 12 years?
**Answer**: 0.048 or 4.8%

**Solution**:
The geometric average return (also called compound annual growth rate or CAGR) is calculated using:
R_g = (FV/PV)^(1/n) - 1

Where:
- PV = Initial investment = $9,000
- FV = Final value = $15,797
- n = Number of years = 12

R_g = ($15,797/$9,000)^(1/12) - 1
R_g = (1.7552...)^(1/12) - 1
R_g = 1.048 - 1
R_g = 0.048 or 4.8%

## Problem 15: Arithmetic vs. Geometric Average Returns
**Question**: A stock delivered the following annual returns over the last 4 years:

| Year | Return |
|------|--------|
| 1    | 5%     |
| 2    | 3%     |
| 3    | -8%    |
| 4    | 7%     |

**Question Part 1**: What was the arithmetic average return over the 4 years?
**Answer**: 0.0175 or 1.75%

**Question Part 2**: What was the geometric average return over the 4 years?
**Answer**: 0.01578 or 1.578%

**Question Part 3**: If you invested $1,000 at the beginning, how much would you have had at the end?
**Answer**: $1,064.63

**Question Part 4**: What is the standard deviation of the stock's return based on the historical data?
**Answer**: 0.067 or 6.7%

**Solution**:
For Part 1 (Arithmetic average):
Arithmetic Average = (0.05 + 0.03 + (-0.08) + 0.07) / 4 = 0.07 / 4 = 0.0175 or 1.75%

For Part 2 (Geometric average):
Geometric Average = [(1 + 0.05) × (1 + 0.03) × (1 + (-0.08)) × (1 + 0.07)]^(1/4) - 1
= [(1.05) × (1.03) × (0.92) × (1.07)]^(1/4) - 1
= [1.05 × 1.03 = 1.0815, 1.0815 × 0.92 = 0.99498, 0.99498 × 1.07 = 1.064629]^(1/4) - 1
= (1.064629)^(1/4) - 1
= 1.01578 - 1
= 0.01578 or 1.578%

For Part 3 (Final investment value):
Final Value = $1,000 × (1 + 0.05) × (1 + 0.03) × (1 + (-0.08)) × (1 + 0.07)
= $1,000 × 1.064629
= $1,064.63

For Part 4 (Standard deviation):
Mean = 0.0175
Deviations:
- (0.05 - 0.0175) = 0.0325
- (0.03 - 0.0175) = 0.0125
- (-0.08 - 0.0175) = -0.0975
- (0.07 - 0.0175) = 0.0525

Squared deviations:
- (0.0325)² = 0.001056
- (0.0125)² = 0.000156
- (-0.0975)² = 0.009506
- (0.0525)² = 0.002756

Sum of squared deviations = 0.013474
Variance = 0.013474 / (4-1) = 0.013474 / 3 = 0.004491
Standard Deviation = √0.004491 = 0.067 or 6.7%

## Problem 16: Standard Deviation of Returns
**Question**: You've recorded the following sample of historical annual returns for a stock:

| Year | Return |
|------|--------|
| 1    | 8%     |
| 2    | 2%     |
| 3    | -14%   |
| 4    | 3%     |
| 5    | 7%     |

**Question Part 1**: What was the standard deviation of returns?
**Answer**: 0.0887 or 8.87%

**Solution**:
Step 1: Calculate the arithmetic mean
Mean = (0.08 + 0.02 + (-0.14) + 0.03 + 0.07) / 5 = 0.06 / 5 = 0.012 or 1.2%

Step 2: Calculate deviations from the mean
- Year 1: 0.08 - 0.012 = 0.068
- Year 2: 0.02 - 0.012 = 0.008
- Year 3: -0.14 - 0.012 = -0.152
- Year 4: 0.03 - 0.012 = 0.018
- Year 5: 0.07 - 0.012 = 0.058

Step 3: Square the deviations
- Year 1: (0.068)² = 0.004624
- Year 2: (0.008)² = 0.000064
- Year 3: (-0.152)² = 0.023104
- Year 4: (0.018)² = 0.000324
- Year 5: (0.058)² = 0.003364

Step 4: Sum the squared deviations = 0.031480

Step 5: Divide by (n-1) for sample standard deviation
Variance = 0.031480 / 4 = 0.007870

Step 6: Take the square root
Standard Deviation = √0.007870 = 0.0887 or 8.87%

## Problem 17: Probability of Loss
**Question**: Investing Shark Burgers has an expected annual return of 40% and a standard deviation of 20%.

**Question Part 1**: What is the probability of losing money on this investment? Assume that returns are normally distributed.
**Answer**: 0.023 or 2.3%

**Solution**:
To find the probability of losing money, we need to find P(R < 0).

Step 1: Standardize using the Z-score formula
Z = (X - μ) / σ
For X = 0 (breaking even):
Z = (0 - 0.40) / 0.20 = -0.40 / 0.20 = -2.0

Step 2: Find the probability using the standard normal distribution
P(R < 0) = P(Z < -2.0) ≈ 0.0228 ≈ 0.023 or 2.3%

This makes intuitive sense because the expected return (40%) is two standard deviations (2 × 20% = 40%) above zero. In a normal distribution, approximately 2.3% of outcomes fall more than 2 standard deviations below the mean.

## Problem 18: Stock Returns with Dividends
**Question**: The following table shows historical end-of-year prices for a stock and the future value of all dividends paid throughout the year:

| Year | Price  | Dividends |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 2016 | 64.94  |           |
| 2017 | 63.01  | 1.21      |
| 2018 | 62.38  | 1.21      |
| 2019 | 65.39  | 1.25      |
| 2020 | 63.09  | 1.25      |
| 2021 | 64.86  | 1.25      |
| 2022 | 61.05  | 1.30      |
| 2023 | 61.08  | 1.30      |
| 2024 | 61.96  | 1.30      |

**Question Part 1**: What was the arithmetic average annual return?
**Answer**: 0.0146 or 1.46%

**Question Part 2**: What was the geometric average annual return?
**Answer**: 0.0140 or 1.40%

**Solution**:
First, we need to calculate annual returns for each year:

2017: (63.01 - 64.94 + 1.21) / 64.94 = -0.0111
2018: (62.38 - 63.01 + 1.21) / 63.01 = 0.0092
2019: (65.39 - 62.38 + 1.25) / 62.38 = 0.0683
2020: (63.09 - 65.39 + 1.25) / 65.39 = -0.0161
2021: (64.86 - 63.09 + 1.25) / 63.09 = 0.0479
2022: (61.05 - 64.86 + 1.30) / 64.86 = -0.0387
2023: (61.08 - 61.05 + 1.30) / 61.05 = 0.0218
2024: (61.96 - 61.08 + 1.30) / 61.08 = 0.0357

For arithmetic average:
Average = (-0.0111 + 0.0092 + 0.0683 + (-0.0161) + 0.0479 + (-0.0387) + 0.0218 + 0.0357) / 8
= 0.1170 / 8
= 0.0146 or 1.46%

For geometric average:
Product of (1 + return) for each year:
(1 - 0.0111) × (1 + 0.0092) × (1 + 0.0683) × (1 - 0.0161) × (1 + 0.0479) × (1 - 0.0387) × (1 + 0.0218) × (1 + 0.0357)
= 0.9889 × 1.0092 × 1.0683 × 0.9839 × 1.0479 × 0.9613 × 1.0218 × 1.0357
= 0.9889 × 1.0092 = 0.9980
= 0.9980 × 1.0683 = 1.0660
= 1.0660 × 0.9839 = 1.0481
= 1.0481 × 1.0479 = 1.0989
= 1.0989 × 0.9613 = 1.0563
= 1.0563 × 1.0218 = 1.0793
= 1.0793 × 1.0357 = 1.1178

Geometric Average = (1.1178)^(1/8) - 1 = 1.0140 - 1 = 0.0140 or 1.40%

## Problem 19: Effective Annual Rates
**Question**: The quoted interest rate is 5.3% (APR).

**Question Part 1**: What is the effective annual rate if interest is compounded annually?
**Answer**: 0.053 or 5.3%

**Question Part 2**: What is the effective annual rate if interest is compounded quarterly?
**Answer**: 0.0538 or 5.38%

**Question Part 3**: What is the effective annual rate if interest is compounded weekly?
**Answer**: 0.0544 or 5.44%

**Solution**:
The formula for effective annual rate (EAR) is:
EAR = (1 + APR/m)^m - 1

Where:
- APR = Annual Percentage Rate
- m = Number of compounding periods per year

For annual compounding (m = 1):
EAR = (1 + 0.053/1)^1 - 1 = (1 + 0.053)^1 - 1 = 1.053 - 1 = 0.053 or 5.3%

For quarterly compounding (m = 4):
EAR = (1 + 0.053/4)^4 - 1 = (1 + 0.01325)^4 - 1 = 1.0538 - 1 = 0.0538 or 5.38%

For weekly compounding (m = 52):
EAR = (1 + 0.053/52)^52 - 1 = (1 + 0.001019)^52 - 1 = 1.0544 - 1 = 0.0544 or 5.44%

This demonstrates how more frequent compounding leads to a higher effective annual rate, even with the same quoted APR.

## Problem 20: Treasury Bill Returns
**Question**: You bought a 1-year Treasury bill with a face value of $1,000 for $919.7. 4 months later, you sold it for $945.72.

**Question Part 1**: What was your total return over the 4 months?
**Answer**: 0.0283 or 2.83%

**Question Part 2**: What was your monthly return?
**Answer**: 0.0070 or 0.70%

**Question Part 3**: What was your annualized return?
**Answer**: 0.087 or 8.7%

**Solution**:
For total return over 4 months:
R = (Ending Price - Beginning Price) / Beginning Price
R = ($945.72 - $919.70) / $919.70 = $26.02 / $919.70 = 0.0283 or 2.83%

For monthly return:
Monthly Return = (1 + Total Return)^(1/4) - 1
Monthly Return = (1 + 0.0283)^(1/4) - 1 = (1.0283)^0.25 - 1 = 1.0070 - 1 = 0.0070 or 0.70%

For annualized return:
Annualized Return = (1 + Total Return)^(12/4) - 1
Annualized Return = (1 + 0.0283)^3 - 1 = (1.0283)^3 - 1 = 1.0871 - 1 = 0.0871 or 8.7% (rounded to 3 decimal places)

# Financial Formulas Cheat Sheet

## Return Calculations
- **Holding Period Return**: R = (P₁ - P₀ + D₁) / P₀
  - P₁ = Ending price
  - P₀ = Beginning price
  - D₁ = Dividend payment

- **Arithmetic Average Return**: R̄ = (R₁ + R₂ + ... + Rₙ) / n

- **Geometric Average Return**: Rg = [(1 + R₁) × (1 + R₂) × ... × (1 + Rₙ)]^(1/n) - 1

- **Monthly Return from Total Return**: rm = (1 + R)^(1/n) - 1

- **Annualized Return**: ra = (1 + R)^(12/n) - 1 (where n is number of months)

## Risk Measures
- **Standard Deviation**: σ = √[Σ(Ri - R̄)² / (n-1)]

- **Risk Premium**: RP = Expected Return on Asset - Risk-Free Rate

- **Excess Return**: ER = Asset Return - Risk-Free Rate

## Interest Rates
- **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)**: EAR = (1 + APR/m)^m - 1
  - APR = Annual Percentage Rate
  - m = Number of compounding periods per year

## Probability
- **Z-score**: Z = (X - μ) / σ
  - X = Value of interest
  - μ = Mean
  - σ = Standard deviation
